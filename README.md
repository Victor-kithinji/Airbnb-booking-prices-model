According to the results, linear regression appears to be a better option than random forest regression. 
In linear regression, the coefficients shed light on how the independent and dependent variables relate to one another. 
The dependent variable's baseline value is established by the intercept term. The linear regression model appears to perform more predictably than the random forest regression model, as indicated by its reduced mean squared error (MSE). 
The linear regression model also has a higher coefficient of determination (R2), indicating a better match to the data. 
Given these variables, linear regression seems to provide more insightful predictions and better predictive performance in this particular situation. 
When deciding between two options, it's crucial to take the context, data qualities, and analytic aims into account.
